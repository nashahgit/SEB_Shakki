								            	The CGBA qualification is tailored to senior managers who have degrees or professional qualifications in all business fields (marketing, management, finance, banking, accounting etc.).

It is open for those who have a degree or professional qualification in any business discipline (both accounting and non-accounting). Non-business degree holders and professionals also are eligible if they have over 5-years of business experience. A participant must have at least 5-years of senior business experience to enroll in program. The assessments done are the case studies within the Strategic Business Analysis course module.

								            	<h1>Islamic Banking and Finance</h1>
								            	<p>
								            	Islamic banking (Arabic:<span style="font-weight:800;font-size:16px">مصرفية إسلامية</span>‎‎) is banking or banking activity that is consistent with the principles of sharia (Islamic law) and its practical application through the development of Islamic economics. As such, a more correct term for Islamic banking is “sharia compliant finance”. The vital objective of the training in Islamic banking, Finance and in Islamic insurance is building the knowledge and enhancing the competency of personnel serving in this sector with a candid insight of the need to take morality and professionalism into account very earnestly in all their business activities.
								            </p>
								            <p>
								            	The course is designed for students and professionals who are seeking to have more than a basic understanding of the concepts and operating principles that apply to different types of Islamic banking in comparison to conventional banking. Applying Islamic principles in banking in modern markets poses serious challenges for Islamic banks. The importance is on practical implementation of Islamic finance principles in the real world of finance.
								            </p>
								            <h3>Training Overview and Objectives</h3>
								            <p>
								            	The principal aim of the training is to prepare those following a career with the knowledge and skills to be able to handle assertively and efficiently in a new work environment. Through an understanding of concepts and practical experiences individuals are given the opportunity to apply the knowledge learnt to financial situations they are likely to meet at work dealing with clients seeking Shari'ah-compliant products and services.
								            </p>
								            <p>
								            	The essential objective of the training program is to strengthen the knowledge of employees working in the Islamic financial services industry and the Shari'ah-compliant applications. There is also a focus on the professional aspects of the employees' role, and on research and communication skills, alongside their aspirations and achievements.
